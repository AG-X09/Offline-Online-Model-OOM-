# Offline-Online_Model-ROOM
ROOM, a novel Real-time Online-Offline attack construction Model where an offline component serves to warm up the online algorithm, making it possible to generate highly successful attacks under time constraints.

A Pytorch code for our paper: ROOM: Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks Under Real-Time Constraints.
